Paralization of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm using open-mpi, open-mp, avx2, and cuda. 

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a 
weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). The 
algorithm is particularly useful for dense graphs and can be parallelized to improve performance on large datasets.

The Floyd-Warshall is sovled using dynamic programming and the solution algorithm can be parallelized.
