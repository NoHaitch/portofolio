The Raft Consensus Algorithm is a distributed consensus algorithm designed to ensure that multiple nodes in a distributed system 
agree on the same state. This implementation focuses on a single cluster of nodes, providing a foundation for understanding how Raft works.

Includes:
- Heartbeat 
- Leader Election
- Log Replication
- Membership Change
